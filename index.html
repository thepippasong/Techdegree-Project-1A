        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I am interested in building engaging front end experience for users who visit my site, because life is short and we all instinctively appreciate simple yet elegantly designed web experience.
          Honestly, I am not 100% certain if I want to be a professional front- end web dev yet.
            That said, I believe it will be an awesome skill to have, and I always found engaging and beautiful websites inspiring.</p>
        <p>A quick personal background: My family is from Seoul, South Korea but I grew up in England, UK.
          My academic background is in History and Literature, but having a fianceé who is an iOS programmer exposed me to a whole new world of programming and codes.
          I am currently living in Guatemala City, where my fianceé is from.</p>
        <p>I recently graduated from college, and I am trying to figure out what direction I want to take.
          My current interests include baking, reading sci-fi novels and working out with @zova.
          I love sharing time and food with those I care about. I am also interested in alternative, self- directed education.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to become proficient in building beautiful and engaging front- end web experience. The areas I am planning to master include:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As I mentioned before, I am not sure where or how I want to apply this skill I will soon gain. Perhaps a creative agency where I can work with other creative professionals like web designers and iOS/ Android programmers,
          perhaps freelancing. I will figure it out along the exciting journey of this course!
